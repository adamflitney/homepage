            <div class="content">
                <p>This is my first blog entry. I may as well use it to explain what I am doing.
                My plan is to get up to speed with web development by giving myself a series of projects.
                Many of them will be "re-inventing the wheel" and most of them will be really basic and feature lacking to begin with.
                This is all on purpose as I will gain good experience creating things that I will be using myself so will be more motivated to work on them.
                This also has the benefit that my first projects will be things that there are hundreds of tutorials/examples for so if I get stuck I can go through some and pick out techniques I find useful.</p>
                <p>So the basics I want to create are your standard fare:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> A basic homepage/portfolio site that will act as the starting point to everything else and hopefully showcase my creations somewhat when they are of acceptable quality</li>
                <li> A blog to document what I am creating / learning and my musings on things in general </li>
                <li> A pomodoro timer because I find them really useful for forcing me to focus on the task at hand </li>
                <li> A todo list / trello style kanban board type web app because breaking things down into manageable tasks also helps me get things done </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This will then act as a foundation for the things I <em>really</em> want to create which currently are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> A flashcard app for learning Japanese kanji initially, but potentially being extended to include grammar and new vocabulary too </li>
                    <li> A quiz app for japanese vocabulary and potentially grammar too </li>
                    <li> A keto (ketogenic diet) macro calculator because I dont trust/ like the ones I have found so far</li>
                    <li> A keto diet manager as all the current offerings that are any good cost money </li>
                    <li> A roguelike game because I saw a few from the freecodecamp react project and it looked lots of fun </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I'm sure that list will grow and change over time but this is what I have so far.
                My plan is to work iteratively as my skills will be improving gradually so I will want to return back to previous projects quite regularly.
                Each time I start to lose motivation on a current project, I can just switch to a different one and work on creating/improving that.
                As I get more familiar/comfortable with the technologies I will start adding in more complicated features to continually improve my skills.
                So everything will be pretty static to start with with basic styling / using a css library, but gradually I will add functionality and make things more dynamic.
                So this blog for example, is currently just a static page with posts that are just written straight into the html.
                But I will start adding things like more styling, a post generator, shortcuts to previous posts etc. Once I am proficient with front end technologies I will eventually come back and write a back end for dynamic html generation and a login system so only I can create new posts.</p>

                <p>So anyway, that about sums up my what i'm doing and why i'm doing it. Let's see how it goes!</p>
